/**
 * @page page_wp_primary_selection_unstable_v1 The wp_primary_selection_unstable_v1 protocol
 * Primary selection protocol
 *
 * @section page_desc_wp_primary_selection_unstable_v1 Description
 *
 * This protocol provides the ability to have a primary selection device to
 * match that of the X server. This primary selection is a shortcut to the
 * common clipboard selection, where text just needs to be selected in order
 * to allow copying it elsewhere. The de facto way to perform this action
 * is the middle mouse button, although it is not limited to this one.
 *
 * Clients wishing to honor primary selection should create a primary
 * selection source and set it as the selection through
 * wp_primary_selection_device.set_selection whenever the text selection
 * changes. In order to minimize calls in pointer-driven text selection,
 * it should happen only once after the operation finished. Similarly,
 * a NULL source should be set when text is unselected.
 *
 * wp_primary_selection_offer objects are first announced through the
 * wp_primary_selection_device.data_offer event. Immediately after this event,
 * the primary data offer will emit wp_primary_selection_offer.offer events
 * to let know of the mime types being offered.
 *
 * When the primary selection changes, the client with the keyboard focus
 * will receive wp_primary_selection_device.selection events. Only the client
 * with the keyboard focus will receive such events with a non-NULL
 * wp_primary_selection_offer. Across keyboard focus changes, previously
 * focused clients will receive wp_primary_selection_device.events with a
 * NULL wp_primary_selection_offer.
 *
 * In order to request the primary selection data, the client must pass
 * a recent serial pertaining to the press event that is triggering the
 * operation, if the compositor deems the serial valid and recent, the
 * wp_primary_selection_source.send event will happen in the other end
 * to let the transfer begin. The client owning the primary selection
 * should write the requested data, and close the file descriptor
 * immediately.
 *
 * If the primary selection owner client disappeared during the transfer,
 * the client reading the data will receive a
 * wp_primary_selection_device.selection event with a NULL
 * wp_primary_selection_offer, the client should take this as a hint
 * to finish the reads related to the no longer existing offer.
 *
 * The primary selection owner should be checking for errors during
 * writes, merely cancelling the ongoing transfer if any happened.
