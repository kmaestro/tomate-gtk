/**
 * @page page_keyboard_shortcuts_inhibit_unstable_v1 The keyboard_shortcuts_inhibit_unstable_v1 protocol
 * Protocol for inhibiting the compositor keyboard shortcuts
 *
 * @section page_desc_keyboard_shortcuts_inhibit_unstable_v1 Description
 *
 * This protocol specifies a way for a client to request the compositor
 * to ignore its own keyboard shortcuts for a given seat, so that all
 * key events from that seat get forwarded to a surface.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
 * backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible
 * changes may be added together with the corresponding interface
 * version bump.
 * Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version
 * number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the
 * interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable,
 * the 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and
 * interface names are removed and the interface version number is
 * reset.

 *
 * A keyboard shortcuts inhibitor instructs the compositor to ignore
 * its own keyboard shortcuts when the associated surface has keyboard
 * focus. As a result, when the surface has keyboard focus on the given
 * seat, it will receive all key events originating from the specified
 * seat, even those which would normally be caught by the compositor for
 * its own shortcuts.
 *
 * The Wayland compositor is however under no obligation to disable
 * all of its shortcuts, and may keep some special key combo for its own
 * use, including but not limited to one allowing the user to forcibly
 * restore normal keyboard events routing in the case of an unwilling
 * client. The compositor may also use the same key combo to reactivate
 * an existing shortcut inhibitor that was previously deactivated on
 * user request.
 *
 * When the compositor restores its own keyboard shortcuts, an
 * "inactive" event is emitted to notify the client that the keyboard
 * shortcuts inhibitor is not effectively active for the surface and
 * seat any more, and the client should not expect to receive all
 * keyboard events.
 *
 * When the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor is inactive, the client has
 * no way to forcibly reactivate the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor.
 *
 * The user can chose to re-enable a previously deactivated keyboard
 * shortcuts inhibitor using any mechanism the compositor may offer,
 * in which case the compositor will send an "active" event to notify
 * the client.
 *
 * If the surface is destroyed, unmapped, or loses the seat's keyboard
 * focus, the keyboard shortcuts inhibitor becomes irrelevant and the
 * compositor will restore its own keyboard shortcuts but no "inactive"
 * event is emitted in this case.
