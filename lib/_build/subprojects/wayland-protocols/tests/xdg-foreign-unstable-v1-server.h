/**
 * @page page_xdg_foreign_unstable_v1 The xdg_foreign_unstable_v1 protocol
 * Protocol for exporting xdg surface handles
 *
 * @section page_desc_xdg_foreign_unstable_v1 Description
 *
 * This protocol specifies a way for making it possible to reference a surface
 * of a different client. With such a reference, a client can, by using the
 * interfaces provided by this protocol, manipulate the relationship between
 * its own surfaces and the surface of some other client. For example, stack
 * some of its own surface above the other clients surface.
 *
 * In order for a client A to get a reference of a surface of client B, client
 * B must first export its surface using xdg_exporter.export. Upon doing this,
 * client B will receive a handle (a unique string) that it may share with
 * client A in some way (for example D-Bus). After client A has received the
 * handle from client B, it may use xdg_importer.import to create a reference
 * to the surface client B just exported. See the corresponding requests for
 * details.
 *
 * A possible use case for this is out-of-process dialogs. For example when a
 * sandboxed client without file system access needs the user to select a file
 * on the file system, given sandbox environment support, it can export its
 * surface, passing the exported surface handle to an unsandboxed process that
 * can show a file browser dialog and stack it above the sandboxed client's
 * surface.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
 * incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
 * together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
 * incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
 * and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
 * is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
 * protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
 * reset.
